This is a prototype predictive maintenance model with a simulated sensor data to simulate real life maintenance model with iot sensor dataset.
This model predicts and alerts when the system needs an overlook.
This model can reduce a huge sum of maintanence cost as the precautions would be taken with the help of this model.
---------------
s2.py is the working model
